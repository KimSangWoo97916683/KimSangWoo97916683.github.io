# KimSangWoo97916683's SLADE 3 Page - 2024.

You found my page or code on my github, so welcome!

It was created with the intention of showing all the work I have done over time with the SLADE 3 doom editor made by Simon Judd. Also to show the evolution I've had in terms of editing mods.

Today 2024 I started to be interested in editing mods in SLADE 3 Although I started to release them officially in 2024.

Work continues to maintain a better web page.
